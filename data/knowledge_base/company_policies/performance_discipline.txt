SECTION 2: PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE

PHILOSOPHY
TechNova uses a progressive discipline approach designed to give employees fair warning and an opportunity to correct performance or behavioral issues before more serious action is taken. The goal is employee improvement, not punishment.

STEP 1: VERBAL COUNSELING
- Manager has a private conversation with the employee about the concern
- Clear expectations and specific examples discussed
- Manager documents the conversation in writing (date, topic, agreed actions)
- Follow-up check-in scheduled within 2 weeks
- Not placed in the official personnel file but retained by the manager

STEP 2: WRITTEN WARNING
- Issued when verbal counseling has not resolved the issue
- Formal written notice describing the specific performance or conduct issue
- Clear statement of expectations and timeline for improvement (typically 30 days)
- Consequences of continued issues are stated
- Employee acknowledges receipt (signature does not mean agreement)
- Placed in the employee's personnel file
- Copy to HR for tracking

STEP 3: PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT PLAN (PIP)
- Formal 30, 60, or 90-day plan with specific, measurable goals
- Weekly check-in meetings between employee and manager
- HR participates in PIP creation and monitors progress
- Plan clearly states that failure to meet requirements may result in termination
- Employee receives written notification and has the opportunity to provide input
- At the end of the PIP period:
  - Successful: PIP closed; continued monitoring for 90 days
  - Partial improvement: PIP may be extended once (up to 30 additional days)
  - Unsuccessful: May result in demotion, reassignment, or termination

STEP 4: TERMINATION
- Last resort after documented progressive discipline steps
- Decision made jointly by the direct manager, HR, and senior leadership
- Employee receives written notification including reason, effective date, and separation details
- Exit interview conducted by HR
- Final paycheck and accrued PTO paid per state law
- COBRA and benefits continuation information provided

EXCEPTIONS TO PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE
Certain serious offenses may warrant immediate termination without prior warnings:
- Theft, fraud, or embezzlement
- Violence or threats of violence
- Possession of weapons on company premises
- Illegal drug use or distribution at work
- Gross insubordination
- Sexual harassment or assault
- Intentional destruction of company property
- Disclosure of trade secrets to competitors
- Falsification of company records or time reporting
