AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT (ADA) - REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS POLICY
TechNova Inc. | Effective January 1, 2026
===========================================================

OVERVIEW
TechNova Inc. is committed to complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and providing reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with disabilities. The ADA applies to employers with 15 or more employees.

DEFINITION OF DISABILITY
Under the ADA, a disability is defined as:
- A physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities
- A record (history) of such an impairment
- Being regarded as having such an impairment

QUALIFIED INDIVIDUAL
A qualified individual with a disability is someone who can perform the essential functions of the job, with or without reasonable accommodation.

THE INTERACTIVE PROCESS
When an employee requests an accommodation or TechNova becomes aware that an accommodation may be needed:
1. The employee or their representative initiates a request (verbal or written)
2. HR schedules an interactive meeting within 5 business days
3. Both parties discuss the nature of the limitation and potential accommodations
4. TechNova identifies possible accommodations in consultation with the employee
5. TechNova selects and implements the most appropriate accommodation
6. Follow-up meeting scheduled within 30 days to assess effectiveness
7. Ongoing communication and adjustments as needed

TYPES OF REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS
Common accommodations TechNova provides include:
- Modified work schedules or flexible hours
- Ergonomic furniture and assistive technology (screen readers, voice recognition software)
- Reassignment to a vacant position if unable to perform current role
- Job restructuring to redistribute non-essential functions
- Modified break schedules
- Remote work arrangements
- Accessible parking and workspace modifications
- Sign language interpreters or captioning services
- Modified training materials or methods
- Leave of absence beyond FMLA entitlement

UNDUE HARDSHIP
TechNova is not required to provide an accommodation that would impose an undue hardship. Undue hardship is determined by considering:
- The cost of the accommodation relative to TechNova's financial resources
- The impact on business operations
- The size and structure of the facility
- The nature of the accommodation

HOW TO REQUEST AN ACCOMMODATION
1. Speak with your manager or contact HR directly at hr@technova.com
2. You do not need to use the words "reasonable accommodation" or "ADA" in your request
3. Simply explain that you need an adjustment or change at work due to a medical condition
4. HR will initiate the interactive process within 5 business days
5. Medical documentation may be requested to verify the disability and need for accommodation

CONFIDENTIALITY
All medical information related to accommodation requests is kept confidential in a separate medical file. Only HR personnel and managers who need to know about restrictions are informed, and only to the extent necessary.

ANTI-RETALIATION
TechNova strictly prohibits retaliation against any employee who requests an accommodation, participates in the interactive process, or files a complaint related to disability discrimination.
