FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT (FMLA) - COMPANY POLICY GUIDE
TechNova Inc. | Effective January 1, 2026
===========================================================

OVERVIEW
The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) is a federal law that provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave per year. TechNova Inc. fully complies with all FMLA requirements.

ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS
To qualify for FMLA leave at TechNova, an employee must meet ALL of the following:
- Have worked for TechNova for at least 12 months (need not be consecutive)
- Have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the leave
- Work at a location where TechNova employs 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius

LEAVE ENTITLEMENT
Eligible employees are entitled to 12 workweeks (480 hours) of unpaid leave during a rolling 12-month period for any of the following reasons:
1. Birth of a child and care of the newborn within one year of birth
2. Placement of a child for adoption or foster care and care of the newly placed child within one year
3. Care of an immediate family member (spouse, child, or parent) with a serious health condition
4. A serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the essential functions of their job
5. Any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the employee's spouse, son, daughter, or parent is a covered military member on covered active duty

MILITARY CAREGIVER LEAVE
An eligible employee who is the spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin of a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness may take up to 26 workweeks of leave during a single 12-month period.

INTERMITTENT LEAVE
FMLA leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced schedule when medically necessary. Employees must make reasonable efforts to schedule leave so as not to unduly disrupt business operations.

NOTICE REQUIREMENTS
- Foreseeable leave: Employee must provide at least 30 days advance notice
- Unforeseeable leave: Employee must provide notice as soon as practicable, generally the same day or next business day
- TechNova HR will respond within 5 business days of receiving a leave request

MEDICAL CERTIFICATION
TechNova may require medical certification from the employee's health care provider for leave due to a serious health condition. The employee has 15 calendar days to provide the certification.

JOB PROTECTION
- Employees returning from FMLA leave are entitled to be restored to the same position or an equivalent position with equivalent pay, benefits, and working conditions
- TechNova will maintain the employee's group health insurance during FMLA leave on the same terms as if the employee had continued to work

PAY DURING FMLA LEAVE
FMLA leave is unpaid. However, TechNova allows employees to substitute accrued paid leave (vacation, sick, personal) for unpaid FMLA leave concurrently. This means the leave counts against both the FMLA entitlement and the paid leave balance.

RETURN TO WORK
Employees returning from FMLA leave taken for their own serious health condition may be required to submit a fitness-for-duty certification from their healthcare provider before returning to work.
