FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT (FLSA) - OVERTIME AND COMPENSATION POLICY
TechNova Inc. | Effective January 1, 2026
===========================================================

OVERVIEW
The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) establishes minimum wage, overtime pay, recordkeeping, and youth employment standards. TechNova complies fully with all federal and applicable state wage and hour laws.

MINIMUM WAGE
- Federal minimum wage: $7.25 per hour
- TechNova's minimum starting wage: $22.00 per hour (significantly above federal and most state minimums)
- Where state or local minimum wage is higher, TechNova pays the higher rate

EXEMPT VS. NON-EXEMPT CLASSIFICATION
Employees are classified as either exempt or non-exempt based on duties and salary:

Exempt Employees (not eligible for overtime):
- Must earn at least $684 per week ($35,568 annually) at the federal level
- Must meet one of the duties tests: Executive, Administrative, Professional, Computer Employee, or Outside Sales
- At TechNova, most salaried managers, senior engineers, and professional staff are classified as exempt
- Exempt employees are paid a fixed salary regardless of hours worked

Non-Exempt Employees (eligible for overtime):
- Entitled to overtime pay at 1.5x their regular rate for hours worked over 40 in a workweek
- At TechNova, hourly employees, junior staff, and some administrative roles are non-exempt
- Must accurately record all hours worked

OVERTIME PAY
- Non-exempt employees earn 1.5 times their regular hourly rate for all hours worked beyond 40 in a single workweek
- The workweek at TechNova runs Monday through Sunday
- Overtime must be pre-approved by the employee's direct manager
- Unauthorized overtime is still compensable but may result in disciplinary action
- Comp time (compensatory time off) in lieu of overtime pay is NOT permitted for private-sector employees under FLSA

CALCULATING REGULAR RATE
The regular rate includes:
- Base hourly wage
- Non-discretionary bonuses (e.g., production bonuses)
- Shift differentials
The regular rate excludes:
- Discretionary bonuses (e.g., holiday bonuses)
- Expense reimbursements
- Paid time off payments

MEAL AND REST BREAKS
Federal law does not require meal or rest breaks. However, TechNova provides:
- 30-minute unpaid lunch break for shifts of 6+ hours
- Two 15-minute paid rest breaks per 8-hour shift
- Breaks under 20 minutes are considered paid work time per FLSA regulations
- Nursing mothers: TechNova provides reasonable break time and a private, non-bathroom space for expressing milk for up to 1 year after the child's birth (per PUMP Act)

RECORDKEEPING
TechNova maintains the following records for all employees as required by FLSA:
- Full name and Social Security number
- Home address and date of birth
- Sex and occupation
- Time and day of week when workweek begins
- Hours worked each day and each workweek
- Regular hourly pay rate
- Total overtime earnings
- Total wages paid each pay period
- Date of payment and pay period covered

Records are retained for at least 3 years for payroll records and 2 years for basic employment records.

COMMON COMPLIANCE ISSUES TO AVOID
- Working off the clock (all work time must be recorded and compensated)
- Misclassifying employees as exempt when they do not meet the duties test
- Deducting pay from exempt employees for partial-day absences
- Requiring non-exempt employees to work through lunch without compensation
- Averaging hours over two or more workweeks

STATE LAW CONSIDERATIONS
Some states have additional requirements:
- California: Daily overtime (over 8 hours/day) and double time (over 12 hours/day)
- Colorado: Overtime after 12 hours/day or 40 hours/week
- Certain states require premium pay on holidays or Sundays
TechNova follows the law most beneficial to the employee when state and federal rules differ.
