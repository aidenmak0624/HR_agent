1. PURPOSE
This policy outlines employee rights and obligations under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), including eligibility, qualifying reasons, and the process for requesting leave.

2. ELIGIBILITY
Employees are eligible for FMLA leave if they:
- Have worked for the company for at least 12 months (need not be consecutive)
- Have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12 months prior to the leave request
- Work at a location where the company employs at least 50 employees within 75 miles

3. QUALIFYING REASONS FOR LEAVE
Eligible employees may take up to 12 workweeks of unpaid, job-protected leave per 12-month period for:
a) Birth of a child and bonding with the newborn (within one year of birth)
b) Placement of a child for adoption or foster care and bonding (within one year of placement)
c) To care for an immediate family member (spouse, child, or parent) with a serious health condition
d) A serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform essential job functions
e) Qualifying exigency arising from a family member's military service

Military Caregiver Leave: Up to 26 workweeks in a single 12-month period to care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness.

4. DEFINITION OF SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITION
A serious health condition is an illness, injury, impairment, or physical/mental condition that involves:
- Inpatient care (overnight stay in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility)
- Continuing treatment by a health care provider, including:
  - Incapacity of more than 3 consecutive full calendar days
  - Two or more treatments within 30 days of incapacity
  - Chronic conditions requiring periodic treatment
  - Pregnancy or prenatal care
  - Permanent or long-term conditions

5. LEAVE REQUEST PROCESS
5.1 Foreseeable Leave:
- Provide at least 30 days' advance notice when the need for leave is foreseeable
- Submit FMLA Request Form to HR department
- Complete medical certification within 15 calendar days

5.2 Unforeseeable Leave:
- Provide notice as soon as practicable (typically the same or next business day)
- Follow normal call-in procedures
- Complete medical certification within 15 calendar days of request

6. MEDICAL CERTIFICATION
- Employees must provide a complete and sufficient medical certification within 15 days
- The company may request a second opinion at its expense
- If the first and second opinions differ, a third opinion (binding) may be obtained
- Recertification may be required every 30 days during leave

7. INTERMITTENT AND REDUCED SCHEDULE LEAVE
- FMLA leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced schedule when medically necessary
- Employees must make reasonable efforts to schedule treatments to minimize disruption
- The company may temporarily transfer the employee to an alternative position with equivalent pay and benefits

8. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS DURING LEAVE
- Health insurance coverage continues on the same terms as if the employee had continued working
- Employee must continue to pay their share of health insurance premiums
- If employee does not return from leave, the company may recover the health insurance premiums paid during leave (with exceptions)

9. JOB RESTORATION
- Employees returning from FMLA leave are entitled to be restored to the same or equivalent position
- Equivalent position has equivalent pay, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment
- Exception: Key employees (highest-paid 10%) may be denied restoration if necessary to prevent substantial economic injury

10. COORDINATION WITH OTHER LEAVE
- FMLA leave runs concurrently with other applicable leave types (paid sick leave, vacation, short-term disability)
- Employees may be required to use available paid leave during FMLA leave
- Workers' compensation leave for FMLA-qualifying conditions counts against FMLA entitlement

11. STATE LAW CONSIDERATIONS
- California Family Rights Act (CFRA): Provides additional 12 weeks for baby bonding
- New York Paid Family Leave: Provides partial wage replacement during qualifying leave
- Other state laws may provide additional protections beyond federal FMLA
- When both federal and state laws apply, the employee receives the greater benefit

12. EMPLOYER RESPONSIBILITIES
- Post FMLA notice in conspicuous workplace locations
- Provide general notice in employee handbook
- Provide eligibility notice within 5 business days of leave request
- Provide designation notice within 5 business days of having sufficient information

13. EMPLOYEE RESPONSIBILITIES

- Discriminate or retaliate against employees for exercising FMLA rights
- Count FMLA-protected absences against attendance policies
